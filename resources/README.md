# Tracker Formats Documentation
Some of the documentation links were obtained from: 
* https://github.com/dbrookman/trackrip 
* https://github.com/a740g/QB64-MOD-Player

Feel free to check out these projects. 

I have also written up some documentation. But they're used internally so not everything is completely documented. 

My docs shouldn't contain anything you won't find in these linked resources.
