# Dumping samples from UMX module containers

Like the title suggests, **UMX** is **not** a standalone tracker module but rather **a container for other modules**. They're used in earlier games that use the Unreal Engine. (Like **Unreal Tournament**, **Deus Ex (2000)**)

For example, Deus Ex's UMX files store Impulse Tracker modules.
