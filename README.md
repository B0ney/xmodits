# XMODITS - A fast & lightweight tool to rip samples from tracker modules

## Supported Formats:

|Format| 8-bit| 16-bit| compression|Stereo|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|IT| ‚úì|‚úì|‚úì|‚è≥|
| XM  | ~| ~| N/A| N/A|
| S3M | ‚úì| ‚úì| N/A| ‚è≥|
| MOD | ‚úì| N/A| N/A| N/A|



|Key| Meaning|
|---|---|
|**‚úì** | Fully supported with little or no bugs|
| **~** | Sorta works |
| **n/a** | Format doesn't support it|
| ‚è≥ | In progress|
| üöß | Part of roadmap |




## Download
You can download builds for xmodits here.

If you wish to build from source, go to [building](#building).

## How to Use

**On Windows, you can simply drag and drop a supported module(s) onto the binary.** 

If successfull, a folder with a similar name to the module should appear.

### In the terminal:

```
xmodits <module path> [destination folder]

e.g:
    xmodits test.s3m ~/Music/Samples/
```
### The destination folder is optional, you can just do this:
```
xmodits test.s3m
```

xmodits will place the ripped samples wherever the program is located.


### Rip from multiple trackers:
```
xmodits mod1.mod mod2.it mod3.s3m [destination folder]
```
### Rip from multiple trackers (Linux):
```
xmodits ./*.mod [destination folder]
```
(I haven't tested this on windows)



## Note
The purpose of this tool (the core) is to dump samples that's it.

You'll notice some dumped samples may not sound identical to what's heard in a tracker module. 

This is because the tracker authour has applied effects such as pitch increase, vibrato.

Replicating these effects is not a top priority. 

## Resources
The resources that made this project possible can be found [here](./resources/).
## Goals
* Fully Support Listed formats.
* Easy to use.
* Simple codebase with very few dependencies. 
* Well documented (self documented code preferred)
* Hackable: Contributors can implement obscure tracker formats.

## Building
Requirements: 
* Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

The easiest way to compile xmodits is through this command.

The binary size should be acceptable (<1MB)

```
cargo build -p xmodits --release
```

## Building (Advanced)
If you want to make the binary size smaller, you can do so here. (nightly version required)

If you have nightly installed, update it to minimize the chance of a build failure:
```
rustup update
```
If you don't have nightly installed:
```
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

To build on windows (MSVC):
```
cargo +nightly build -p xmodits -Z build-std=std,panic_abort --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --release
```
To build on windows (GNU):
```
cargo +nightly build -p xmodits -Z build-std=std,panic_abort --target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release
```


To build on Linux:
```
cargo +nightly build -p xmodits -Z build-std=std,panic_abort --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```
