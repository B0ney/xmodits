<!-- ## Download
You can download builds for xmodits [here](https://github.com/B0ney/xmodits/releases).

If you wish to build from source, go to [building](#building). -->

## Other projects:
* xmodits cli application
* xmodits python library

## How to Use

### Windows: 
You simply drag and drop a module(s) onto the binary.

If successful, a folder with a similar name to the module should appear.

NOTE: xmodits will place the ripped samples wherever the program is located.

### Linux:

```
xmodits <module path> [destination folder]

e.g:
    xmodits test.s3m ~/Music/Samples/
```
### The destination folder is optional, you can just do this:
```
xmodits test.s3m
```

xmodits will place the ripped samples wherever the program is located.


### Rip from multiple trackers:
```
xmodits mod1.mod mod2.it mod3.s3m [destination folder]
```
### Rip from multiple trackers via "*" :
```
xmodits ./*.mod [destination folder]
```
<!-- ### Advanced Arguments
If you want to customize how ripped samples are named, the following arguments can be used:

|short| long| Description|
|--|--|--|
|-i |--index-only| Ripped samples will only be named with an index|
|-r |--index-raw| Preserve internal sample indexing|
|-p |--index-padding| Pad sample index with preceding 0s|
|-n |--no-folder| Do not create a new folder for ripped samples |
|-u |--upper| Name samples in UPPER CASE |
|-l |--lower| Name samples in lower case |
|-c| --with-comment |Include embedded text from tracker (if it exists) ðŸš§|
|-k |--parallel| Rip samples in parallel (Requires compiling with **``features="advanced"``**) | -->

<!-- ## Note
The purpose of this tool (the core) is to dump samples that's it.

You'll notice some dumped samples may not sound identical to what's heard in a tracker module. 

This is because the tracker authour has applied effects such as pitch increase, vibrato.

Replicating these effects is not a top priority.  -->
