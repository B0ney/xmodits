        HOW TO USE.
        -----------

1) Open application
2) Drag and drop a module (and, or a folder full of modules).
3) (Optional) Press "Open" to set the destination folder. Your downloads folder is the default.
5) Press "Start"
6) Press "Show Folder" to see the results.


Currently Supported Formats:
    * Amiga Protracker      - mod
    * Fasttracker 2 module  - xm
    * Scream Tracker 3      - s3m
    * Impulse Tracker       - it/mptm

Supported Containers:
    * Unreal Music Package  - umx

Keyboard Shortcuts:
    * DELETE                - Clears only the selected entries
    * SHIFT + DELETE        - Clears ALL entries
    * CTRL + S / CMD + S    - Saves your configuration


XMODITS is portable software. It will not leave application 
specific artefacts on your system without your knowledge.

When making changes to the configuration, you must manually save it.

When you save, the configuration file can be located at:
    Windows - %appdata%\xmodits\config.toml
    Linux   - ~/.config/xmodits/config.toml
    MacOS   - ~/Library/Application Support/xmodits/config.toml

   
Command line arguments:
    --help      -h      Prints help information 
    --version   -V      Prints app version 
    --info      -i      Prints build information 
    --manual    -m      Prints manual 



        RIPPING.
        --------

=== Current Tracker Information ===

When a file/folder is dropped onto the application, that entry can be clicked on.
If the clicked entry is a valid module, the application will show more information about it.

You can also see what samples it can produce by pressing "View Samples".

From here, the application will launch a new "sample preview" window.
Just like the main window, selecting a sample also shows more information about it.

It is also possible to drag and drop a module onto the previewer.

WARNING: Due to limitations of the MOD format, it is possible for XMODITS to treat almost any file
         as valid a MOD file. The samples it can produce will be garbage, and VERY LOUD.


The sample previewer also features a waveform viewer that can be scrolled by dragging with middle mouse button,
as well as being zoomed in/out with the Up/Down arrow keys or the mouse wheel.


=== Sample Naming ===

Configures how ripped samples should be named.
In most cases, xmodits' default settings should be sufficient.

* Index Only
    Samples are only named with an index. E.g: "1.wav"

* Preserve Index
    Index will match how it is represented internally.

* Prefix Samples
    Samples are prefixed with the tracker's file name.
    E.g. "music1_it - kick.wav"

    NOTE: This is recommended if you are ripping with "Self Contained" disabled,
    as this helps reduce collisisons.

* Upper Case 
    Samples will be named in upper case.
    NOTE: Prefixes will NOT be affected

* Lower Case
    Samples will be named in lower case.
    NOTE: Prefixes will NOT be affected

* Prefer Filename
    Some samples have an additional file name. 
    If present, xmodits will name samples with that.

* Index Padding
    Sets the *minimum* amount of digits an index must have, 
    indexes will be padded with zeros to satisfy this. 
    
    Set to 1 to disable padding.

    NOTE: Unless set to 1, xmodits may override this value to ensure that samples are named consistently.
    For example, if the padding is set to "2", i.e. "01", but a module has 100 samples, the padding is now set to "3".



=== Ripping Configuration ===

* Self Contained 
    Store the extracted samples into a self contained folder. 
    This is done to 1) better organize samples, and 2) avoid collisisons.

    Folders are named after the module's filename. ('.' is replaced with '_')

    For example, samples ripped from "music.s3m" will be placed in {DESTINATION FOLDER}/music_s3m/


* Strict loading
    If enabled, XMODITS will quietly ignore files that don't have the following extensions:
        * it
        * xm
        * s3m
        * mod
        * umx
        * mptm

* Export format 
    Set what audio format to save the ripped samples.

    Supported formats:
        * wav   - Generally recommended
        * aiff  - Very similar to wav, but "wav" should be preferred.
        * its   - Recommended for older tracking software
        * s3i   - Recommended for older tracking software, but "its" should be preferred.
        * 8svx  - Recommended for protracker
        * raw   - Only recommended for testing purposes

* Folder Scan Depth 
    Set how deep a folder can be traversed.

* Worker Threads
    Set how many workers can be used to rip modules in parallel. 
    
    NOTE: More threads doesn't necessarily mean better performance.
          Best to leave it at automatic.



    TIPS.
    _____

If you are on Windows, you might notice your CPU utilisation will peak when ripping. 
This is mostly due to your antivirus scanning the newly ripped samples. 
You can create a dedicated folder and configure your AV to ignore that folder, (as well as the executable).
With this, you should also notice a ~2-4x performance improvement.

Even I was surprised to see how fast it ran on my system.


What can't XMODITS rip?
* Scream Tracker 3 modules that ONLY have adlib instruments (it's not pcm!)
* Protracker 3 modules - pt3, XMODITS may recognise it as an "IFF module" and inform you anyway. This restriction will be lifted for later versions.
* Modules that use "exotic" compression (except IT214 & IT215 since they're quite common in impulse tracker)
* .xm modules below 1.4 (those are quite rare)
