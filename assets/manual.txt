Currently Supported Formats:
    * Amiga Protracker      - mod

XMODITS is portable software, it will not leave application 
specific artefacts on your system. 

When making changes to the configuration, you must manually save it.


The configuration file can be located at:
    Windows - %appdata%\xmodits\config.toml
    Linux   - ~/.config/xmodits/config.toml
    MacOS   - ~/Library/Application Support/xmodits/config.toml
            

        RIPPING.
        --------

=== Current Tracker Information ===




=== Sample Naming ===

Configures how ripped samples should be named.
In most cases, xmodits' default settings should be sufficient.

* Index Only
    Samples are only named with an index. E.g: "1.wav"

* Preserve Index
    Index will match how it is represented internally.

* Prefix Samples
    Samples are prefixed with the tracker's file name.
    E.g. "music1_it - kick.wav"

    NOTE: This is recommended if you are ripping with "Self Contained" disabled,
    as this helps reduce collisisons.

* Upper Case 
    Samples will be named in upper case.
    NOTE: Prefixes will NOT be affected

* Lower Case
    Samples will be named in lower case.
    NOTE: Prefixes will NOT be affected

* Prefer Filename
    Some samples have an additional file name. 
    If present, xmodits will name samples with that.

* Index Padding
    Sets the *minimum* amount of digits an index must have. 
    Indexes will be padded with zeros to match the minimum amount of digits. 
    Set to 1 to disable padding.

    NOTE: Unless set to 1, xmodits may override this value to ensure that samples are named consistently.
    For example, if the padding is set to "2", i.e. "01", but a module has 100 samples, the padding is now set to "3".



=== Ripping Configuration ===

* Self Contained 
    Store the extracted samples into a self contained folder. 
    This is done to 1) better organize samples, and 2) avoid collisisons.

    Folders are named after the module's filename. ('.' is replaced with '_')

    For example, samples ripped from "music.s3m" will be placed in {DESTINATION FOLDER}/music_s3m/


* Strict loading
    If enabled, XMODITS will quietly ignore files that don't have the following extensions:
        * it
        * xm
        * s3m
        * mod
        * umx
        * mptm

* Export format 
    Set what audio format to save the ripped samples.

    Supported formats:
        * wav   - Generally recommended
        * its   - Recommended for older tracking software
        * 8svx  - Recommended for protracker
        * s3i   - Recommended for older tracking software, but "its" should be preferred.
        * aiff  - 
        * raw   - Only recommended for testing purposes

* Folder Scan Depth 
    Set how deep a folder can be traversed.

* Worker Threads
    Set how many workers can be used to rip modules in parallel. 
    
    NOTE: More threads doesn't necessarily mean better performance.
          Best to leave it at automatic.



    TIPS.
    _____

If you are on Windows, you might notice your CPU utilisation will peak when ripping. 
This is mostly due to your anti-virus scanning the newly ripped samples. 
You can create a dedicated folder and configure your AV to ignore that folder, (as well as the executable).
With this, you should also notice a ~2-4x performance improvement.


Even I was surprised to see how fast ran on my system.


What can't XMODITS rip?
* Scream Tracker 3 modules that ONLY have adlib instruments (it's not pcm!)
* Protracker 3 modules - pt3, XMODITS may recognise it and inform you anyway (future versions may support this).
* Modules that use "exotic" compression (except IT214 & IT215 since they're quite common in impulse tracker)
