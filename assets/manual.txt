=== Current Tracker Information ===


=== Sample Naming ===

In most cases, xmodits' default settings should be sufficient.

* Index Only
    Samples are only named with an index. E.g: "1.wav"

* Preserve Index
    Index will match how it is represented internally.

* Prefix Samples
    Samples are prefixed with the tracker's file name.
    E.g. "music1_it - kick.wav"

* Upper Case 
    Samples will be named in upper case.
    NOTE: Prefixes will NOT be affected

* Lower Case
    Samples will be named in lower case.
    NOTE: Prefixes will NOT be affected

* Prefer Filename
    Some samples have an additional file name. 
    If present, xmodits will name samples with that.

* Index Padding
    Sets the *minimum* amount of digits an index must have. 
    Indexes will be padded with zeros to match the minimum amount of digits. 
    Set to 1 to disable padding.

    NOTE: Unless set to 1, xmodits may override this value to ensure that samples are named consistently.
    For example, if the padding is set to "2", i.e. "01", but a module has 100 samples, the padding is now set to "3".


=== Ripping Configuration ===

* Self Contained 
    Store the extracted samples into a new folder.
    folders are named after the module's filename with a few things:

    music.s3m -> music_s3m

* Strict loading - 

* Export format 
    Configure what audio formats to save the ripped samples as

* Folder Scan Depth 
    Configure how deep a folder can be traversed.

* Worker Threads
    Configure how many workers can be used to rip modules in parallel. 
    
    NOTE: More threads doesn't necessarily mean better performance.
          Best to leave it at automatic.

TIPS

If you are on Windows, you might notice your CPU utilisation will peak when ripping. 
This is mostly due to your antivirus scanning the newly ripped samples. 
You can create a dedicated folder and configure your AV to ignore that folder. 
With this, you should also notice a ~2-4x performance improvement.
