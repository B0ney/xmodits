# XMODITS test suite
This simple test suite ensures that the program works as intended.


For each module:
* Check module is valid
* Check module has correct sample count
<!-- * Check module has  -->
* Make sure no panics occur for malformed modules

Sample setup:
* 3 valid tracker modules
* n invalid tracker modules, where n is the number of checks performed
* A tracker module with a hidden quirk if possible
